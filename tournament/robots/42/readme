Well, since I don't have a Linux box and I don't intend to get
one I'll have to make do with the standard Linux programs.
Since cc is one of them I wrote my program in C.  No tricks, just
standard alpha-beta search and a rather stupid evaluation function.
It doesn't even use parallel processing since a Saturday afternoon
was all I had to spend on this program.

The first time `runme' is used for a particular board size it
will compile a program for that board size.  Subesequent uses
involve no compilation.  The reason for having a special program
for each board size is that you can produce better code when
the bounds on the arrays used for representing the state of the
game are known.
