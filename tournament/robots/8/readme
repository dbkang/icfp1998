CilkPousse
==========

This is a pousse-playing program written in Cilk, a language for
multithreaded parallel programming based on ANSI C.  (Visit the Cilk
website at http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cilk/ .)

The program was developed by the Supercomputing Technologies group
of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, with a little help
from our friends.
